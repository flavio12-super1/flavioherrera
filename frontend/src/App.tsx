              This is the homefeeed where users can see their posts and their
              friends posts, uses pagination to load more posts as the user
              scrolls as to not impact loading time and performance
              unfortunately when i was working on the image url generation i
              forgot to remove image url expiration and some of the images are
              no longer available how ever that as been fixed and images will no
              longer expire. The home feed allows nested comments of any depth
              with the ability to insert images, polls, and a message. How ever
              the like button currently doesnt work but wouldnt take long to
              implement
